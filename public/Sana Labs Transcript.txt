sauna labs is

00:00:00:22 - 00:00:06:18
Unknown
two different products that are both sort of focused on the intersection of like knowledge and technology.

00:00:06:18 - 00:00:07:16
Unknown
the learn product,

00:00:07:16 - 00:00:10:13
Unknown
is really trying to improve learning,

00:00:10:13 - 00:00:11:15
Unknown
across all spectrums.

00:00:11:17 - 00:00:16:10
Unknown
all of these different ways that you're sort of taking knowledge from one place and trying to get more people up to speed on that.

00:00:16:10 - 00:00:18:18
Unknown
to sort of complement the learning product, we're building

00:00:18:18 - 00:00:27:16
Unknown
an AI assistant product that sort of allows you to search all of the data, all of the knowledge, all the information that might exist at your organization or company

00:00:27:16 - 00:00:32:23
Unknown
and be able to actually, like, surface really quickly, the knowledge and information that's relevant to you.

00:00:33:18 - 00:00:36:08
Unknown
we're trying to make it so humans learn better.

00:00:36:10 - 00:00:44:15
Unknown
Obviously, we're focused in the corporate world right now. But I think in the future it could grow even further into just how everybody is learning.

00:00:44:15 - 00:00:53:06
Unknown
utilizing AI to make us better, make us more efficient, more effective, but not take away the creativity, not take away the things that make us human.

00:00:53:10 - 00:00:56:12
Unknown
Language. How we speak, how you make art. We make music.

00:00:57:10 - 00:00:58:05
Unknown
excites me.

00:00:58:06 - 00:00:59:07
Unknown
on a personal level.

00:00:59:07 - 00:01:01:01
Unknown
I don't have to spend time

00:01:01:01 - 00:01:03:11
Unknown
on things that I do not want to spend time on.

00:01:03:11 - 00:01:06:07
Unknown
And I also think that in a few years,

00:01:06:07 - 00:01:06:22
Unknown
lambs

00:01:06:22 - 00:01:09:01
Unknown
they're going to be a commodity. They're going to be everywhere.

00:01:09:02 - 00:01:11:20
Unknown
You're going to have them on your phone. You're going to have them in your camera.

00:01:11:20 - 00:01:13:03
Unknown
It's all going to be everywhere.

00:01:14:00 - 00:01:16:22
Unknown
I think design is really at the root of everything we do.

00:01:16:22 - 00:01:21:10
Unknown
people like beautiful spaces, beautiful things, beautiful pieces of art.

00:01:21:10 - 00:01:25:21
Unknown
I don't think that we should negate that in the mundane tasks we're doing every day.

00:01:25:21 - 00:01:30:09
Unknown
every single thing that we do at Sana, you know, you mentioned our website, you mentioned our product.

00:01:30:09 - 00:01:34:04
Unknown
it has so much Scandinavian design influence in it.

00:01:34:04 - 00:01:43:00
Unknown
The intentionality and every detail, the beauty, like nothing is on accident in that office. And, you know, it's actually kind of reflective of why we chose the mall.

00:01:43:00 - 00:01:43:19
Unknown
And as well as

00:01:43:19 - 00:01:54:16
Unknown
everything's intentional and it's on purpose. Right. So, and that's reflective in how we carry ourselves as a business. And I think that's why the Mullen became a very simple option for us as well.

00:03:01:21 - 00:03:04:07
Unknown
it all starts with learning.
