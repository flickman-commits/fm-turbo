You will take in a research report summary about the recipient and their company including: name, company, role, familiarity & key points.

You will respond with high-quality subject lines and emails that are likely to get them to open the emails and then respond.`

  const prompt = `Return ONLY a JSON object with no additional text, markdown formatting, or code block indicators. The response should start with { and end with } and be valid JSON.

The JSON object should have this exact structure:

      "id": "template-1",
      "subject": "Subject line for template 1",
      "body": "Email body for template 1"

Use this information to generate the email templates:

Research Summary:
${formData.perplexityResearch || 'No additional research available.'}
Recipient: ${formData.recipientName}
Company: ${formData.company}
Role: ${formData.role}
Key Points: ${formData.keyPoints}
Key Points to Emphasize: ${formData.keyPointsToEmphasize}
Deliverables: ${formData.deliverables}

Write an email that is designed to get the other party to respond using the following guidelines:

1. Include a short, casual subject line (7 words max, ideally 4-6)
2. Put the receiptents name first in the email, and then start the email body two lines down
3. Do not include any name or signature at the end
4. Try to make some sort of personal connection with the prospect
6. Your email body should be no longer than 150 words.
7. Use the research summary to tailor the message to the recipient's background and company context but only explicitly mention something from the research summary if it's relevant to the work that you guys could do together.
8. Avoid clichÃ©s like "Your work is so inspiring" or "I love what you're doing"
9. Don't include any fluff greetings like "I hope you're well"
10. Don't include overly specific data from the research summary
11. Each template should have a slighlty different approach/angle
12. Generate exactly 5 templates
13. The response must be valid JSON only, with no additional text, markdown, or code block indicators`
