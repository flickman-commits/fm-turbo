the outdoors has always been a big part of my life. I grew up in northern Michigan, where my childhood consisted of biking, hiking, skiing, swimming in Lake Superior. So the outdoor lifestyle's always been central to me. On a personal level, as I grew older and, you know, took trips to ski trips, went to national parks.

00:00:20:09 - 00:00:44:07
Unknown
You know, the thing that really stuck out to me was there's a lack of hotel product that had really had personality, had soul that reflected, you know, the unique character of these destinations. So that's how outbound was born. The moment for me was, several years back. One of my partners was at the Grand Canyon, and he texted me and said, hey, man, you got to do a cool hotel here.

00:00:44:09 - 00:01:06:09
Unknown
I'm I'm paying 600 bucks to stay at a crappy old motel. There's no good restaurants in town. And that was kind of the moment that the idea of outbound was born. And outbound is, Really, we're just setting out to create, you know, unique hotels that reflect the character of these, you know, really great locales. They're great, great restaurants.

00:01:06:11 - 00:01:10:02
Unknown
You know, and they really tap into these local communities and the local vibe.

00:01:10:02 - 00:01:33:16
Unknown
The outdoors has always been really a central part of my lifestyle. Ever since I was growing up in northern Michigan, biking, hiking, swimming in Lake Superior, those are really central to my upbringing and my lifestyle. As I got older and I was taking ski trips and going to national parks, the one thing that really stuck out to me is a lack of, you know, cool, interesting hotel products in these markets.

00:01:33:18 - 00:01:54:04
Unknown
But the real moment for me was several years ago, when one of our partners was at the Grand Canyon and he texted me and said, hey man, you've got to do a cool hotel here. I pay in 600 bucks to stay at a, you know, rundown old motel. The place is buzzing. There's no good restaurants. There's a real opportunity here.

00:01:54:06 - 00:02:17:05
Unknown
And that's when the light bulb went off for me. So that's the idea. You know, the idea of outbound was born at that point. And outbound, really, what we're setting out to do is build unique, soulful properties and outdoor locations, beach towns, ski towns, national park towns. Really? Anywhere where nature is the reason you're there.

00:02:17:05 - 00:02:39:11
Unknown
if I describe about in one word, it would be connection. In today's world, you know, we're more connected than ever, yet we're also more disconnected than ever. So outbound is really, what goes. I start starting over. If I do, if I had to describe outbound in one word, it would be a connection.

00:02:39:13 - 00:03:01:16
Unknown
You know, today's world. You know, even though we're more connected than ever with social media, the internet, mobile technology, we're also more disconnected than ever. So connection is really at the heart of what outbound is all about. Obviously, when you come to an outbound property, you're going to you know, reconnect with nature. But it's also about connecting with fellow traveler, like minded travelers.

00:03:01:17 - 00:03:24:08
Unknown
It's about connecting with your friends and family. It's about connecting with these really cool towns. And locations that you travel to when you come to an outbound. So connection is at the heart of what we do. It drives every decision when we're developing a property, from how we lay out the rooms to how we design a restaurant, to how we create really cool outdoor spaces, for people to gather.

00:03:24:09 - 00:03:28:12
Unknown
Everything always comes back to the question of how does this foster connection?

00:03:28:12 - 00:03:47:02
Unknown
Every decision we make when redeveloping a property is filtered through the lens of connection. You know, for instance, we have our version of happy hour, which is called Ember Hours, which revolves around our communal fire pits. It's a great way to, you know, come in after a day of being outdoors and hang out by a fire with friends and family.

00:03:47:03 - 00:04:09:21
Unknown
Maybe a grab a guitar from the lobby and, you know, strum some tunes. Another another example is our bars and restaurants. They're really vessels to connect people. Not only fellow travelers, but locals. So when you go into our bars and restaurants, there's usually half, half the room is low. Yeah. Let me start over. And if you ever find yourself stumbling on something, just pause.

00:04:09:21 - 00:04:35:00
Unknown
Take a breath. Go cut it. Okay. Feel free to, like, take as long as you want to. Okay. So just keep going. Okay. I'm still rolling. So whenever you're ready, go for it. Footsteps. All right. And action. Every decision we make when we develop these properties is filtered through the lens of connection. For instance, we have a half hour version of happy hour is called Ember Hours, which revolves around our communal fire pits.

00:04:35:01 - 00:04:56:09
Unknown
It's a great way to unwind after a long day outdoors, hang out with friends and family, make new friends. Our bars and restaurants is another example of how we connect. People in our bars and restaurants appeal not only to the hotel guests, but they're also very popular with locals. So it's a way for our hotel guests to experience some local flavor.

00:04:56:11 - 00:05:22:15
Unknown
What's the third thing? Music. And finally, music is really central to the ethos of outbound. You know, every almost every night at our properties. Love some local live music. We also do what's called the Outbound Music series, where we bring in larger artists who typically wouldn't play a venue as intimate as our hotels. But music is really key to the, fostering connections as well.

00:05:22:15 - 00:05:43:20
Unknown
If I describe outbound in one word, it would be connection. Connection to the outdoors. Connection to your fellow travelers. Connection to your friends and family. And most of all, connecting to these local communities which are super cool. Have great cultures, really rich cultures, and are fun places to hang out. Something like that.

00:05:43:20 - 00:06:10:18
Unknown
If I had to describe outbound in one word, it would be connection. Connection to the outdoors. Connections to your fellow travelers. Connections to your friends and family and connection to these really cool locations where hotels are located. In today's world, we're so disconnected and the outbound and today's world we're so disconnected and outbound is a way to foster those connections.

00:06:10:18 - 00:06:34:03
Unknown
If I had to describe outbound in one word, there would be a connection. In today's world, we're so connected, yet we're so disconnected. Outbound is a way to foster those connections. Connections, the outdoors, connections to friends and family, connections to fellow like minded travelers, and connections to these local communities where our hotels are located.

00:06:34:03 - 00:06:56:08
Unknown
If I had to describe outbound in one word, it would be connection. In today's world, we're more connected than ever. Yet we feel so disconnected. Outbound hotels is a chance to reconnect. Reconnect with things that matter. The outdoors. New friends reconnect with old friends and connect with the really cool locations that you know.

00:06:56:08 - 00:06:58:10
Unknown
These hotels are located on.

00:06:58:10 - 00:07:13:10
Unknown
Action. Outbound appeals to people who want a glamping experience, but they don't want to sleep in a tent at most of our outbound properties. We have a variety of room types. We have cabins. We have traditional hotel rooms. We have villas. There's something for everyone.

00:07:13:10 - 00:07:30:09
Unknown
outbound appeals to people who want a glamping experience but don't want to sleep in the tents. At our outbound properties, we have a variety of room types. We have really well-appointed cabins. We have traditional hotel rooms. We have villas. We have something for everyone.

00:07:36:21 - 00:07:50:23
Unknown
Outbound exists because there is nothing else like it in the lodging category. A place where people can feel all the benefits of being close to nature and also have all the comforts of hospitality.

00:07:50:23 - 00:08:06:08
Unknown
What makes an outbound and outbound is how it makes you feel. It's a place that makes you feel. Hold on to the feeling, really, of all of the benefits of being in a beautiful place with people that you want to connect with.

00:08:06:08 - 00:08:17:14
Unknown
We say that what makes an outbound? An outbound is a passionate innkeepers sensibility. And what we mean by that is a place where you feel cared about and cared for.

00:08:17:14 - 00:08:34:07
Unknown
One of the things that makes an outbound, an outbound is the passionate innkeepers sensibility. And what we mean by that is a place where you can feel cared about and cared for, that can set your mind at ease, where you can appreciate where you are and the people that you're with.

00:08:34:11 - 00:09:09:05
Unknown
Outbound is a different kind of hospitality experience. There are alternatives. You can stay at a hard branded hotel in one of these beautiful locations, or maybe one of these small, older motels that are near these places. But we built outbound to accommodate those guests that want a little more, that are looking for a design experience, that are looking for, a place where they can relax and be outside and hold on to that feeling of being in that special place with other special people.

00:09:09:05 - 00:09:37:05
Unknown
The design philosophy of outbound hotels is all the things that matter most to you as a guest. There's a sense of sincerity. There's a sense of place, but it isn't contrived. It isn't reaching for the easy button associated with the place. It's integrating what makes that place special. And it might be in a piece of artwork, an accessory, a throw pillow, or in the sincere way that someone is greeted as a guest.

00:09:37:10 - 00:10:07:16
Unknown
But the design philosophy should be an extension of what makes that place special, as well as what makes outbound outbound, which ultimately is a crafted experience. It's a place where things have a sense of purpose, a sense of place, a sense of uniqueness, a sense of wonder, and all wrapped into an experience that can be appreciate by those who know the difference between a great design and simply accommodation.

00:10:07:16 - 00:10:28:19
Unknown
The design philosophy of outbound hotels is really sincerity and sense of place. It's a place that celebrates the uniqueness of its location. It might be in the materials, it might be in its history, but it's tangible. It's something that you can feel as a guest. And it isn't just the easy button or the expected.

00:10:28:19 - 00:10:38:22
Unknown
So by easy button, I mean if we're doing our project in Stowe, Vermont, it isn't all maple sirup and fall leaves.

00:10:39:00 - 00:10:51:10
Unknown
It really is what makes Stowe a special place for everyone, whether you're there for the mountains in winter or the trails in summer. It's something that feels just a little bit different.

00:10:51:10 - 00:11:10:16
Unknown
We're intentional about where outbound hotels can live can be. We want them to be in the mix, not in the woods. Close enough to town that you can stroll into town and get something to eat or drink or go shopping, but remote enough that you feel connected to nature that's around you.

00:11:10:16 - 00:11:33:20
Unknown
Probably the most important thing about an 8 pound hotel is how it makes you feel that you've arrived somewhere that's comfortable, and that you're being warmly welcomed, that there's still a sense of discovery. Maybe that sense of discovery that you had in the area can extend to the quality of the coffee or the people that you meet around a campfire at night.

00:11:33:22 - 00:11:39:20
Unknown
But how you feel is critically important to outbound, because we want you to feel special.

00:11:39:20 - 00:12:12:18
Unknown
one of the most interesting journeys we've been on is the creation of the outbound brand, because we wanted it to feel like it was unique, that it was designed for both those people who were active outdoors people, or in the people who just wanted a comfortable, interesting place to stay. And so the brand and its philosophy was really about how do we accomplish that goal, a place that feels of the place and a place that feels like it's adding something else to the place.

00:12:12:20 - 00:12:38:02
Unknown
And so the brand lives in both the spirit of the brand and the people who feel like they belong to that location, and the vendors who are providing us with our local craft beers or the art on the walls. And yet it attracts people from all over the country who are seeking that unique welcome, that unique sense of hospitality that feels like them.

00:12:38:02 - 00:13:11:06
Unknown
one of the key missions of the outbound brand is how to extend that feeling you have when you are in nature and you're feeling that sense of discovery, that deep breath, that reconnection, how could we extend that feeling into the hospitality experience so it doesn't fall off immediately after you leave the trail? Or leave the mountains that you're able to extend that feeling of comfort, that feeling of discovery, that feeling of warmth, that feeling of hospitality.

00:13:11:08 - 00:13:20:18
Unknown
How do we create a place that keeps that benefit of nature and extends that into a hospitality environment?

00:13:20:18 - 00:13:41:21
Unknown
Bound is a brand is a bit of a balancing act. Actually, there are things that you will find at every outbound hotel, like a comfortable bed or a great playlist, or live music by the campfire, or our Ember Hour, where you can enjoy delicious s'mores with friends and new friends. And then there are things that change from outbound to outbound.

00:13:41:21 - 00:13:56:16
Unknown
But you know you'll can always get a great cup of coffee. We're just partnering with different roasters nearby. And lastly, there will be those things that you can only find at that one outbound hotel, because that's special to that location.

00:13:56:16 - 00:14:25:00
Unknown
One of my favorite activations we did recently was that we invited local artists who are screen printers to do a Pop-Up event at our location in Jackson Hole, and we literally brought a steamroller in and a giant screen, printing paper and screens and inks and use the steamroller to create custom, beautiful artwork that was for sale. And it was also, framed and placed within our hotel.

00:14:25:01 - 00:14:34:11
Unknown
It was a great celebration of local art, local artists, and activations that brought people together in a fun new outdoor kind of experience.

00:14:34:11 - 00:14:56:00
Unknown
The Outbound Guest is a really broad spectrum because it's everyone who appreciates great hospitality and the great outdoors. It's someone who might be traveling alone or someone who's traveling with friends or family. It's people who enjoy meeting other people and feeling what is unique to each location.

00:14:56:00 - 00:15:24:18
Unknown
One. Action. One of the things that we know about our guests is that they choose to go to these incredibly beautiful locations because of how it makes them feel. And when you have that beauty of nature around you, and it brings a smile to your face, and it brings a warmth into your heart, we want to be able to extend that into the hospitality experience, not have it fall off where you find yourself in a disappointing hotel with very little character.

00:15:24:20 - 00:15:34:04
Unknown
Outbound is designed to extend that good feeling about how you feel about yourself, how you feel about nature, how maybe you feel about the people that you're with.

00:15:34:04 - 00:16:00:18
Unknown
We know that the reason people go to these beautiful locations throughout our beautiful country is to enjoy nature, and how it makes them feel, that connection that they're feeling between themselves and the beautiful surroundings and the people that they're with. We don't want that to fall off when they show up at our hotel. We want to extend that feeling and make people feel warm and welcome, and let them continue to feel great about the people they're with and the place that they're at.

00:16:00:18 - 00:16:32:13
Unknown
outbound exists because people want more. They want an experience that feels sensible, sensitive, styled and a bit seductive. And that's what we give them. We give them a place that feels like them. A place that feels designed to be. A place with interesting food and beverage, with people who are welcoming you because they're sincere innkeepers that are trying to give you an experience that feels like the place where that outbound hotel exists.

00:16:32:15 - 00:16:34:08
Unknown
All right. I got to admit, I was a bit too.

00:16:34:08 - 00:16:56:17
Unknown
outbound exists because our guests want more. They want a place that feels like the place. A place that feels like it's been styled to their sense of style. A place that has food and beverage that doesn't just feel like any food and beverage, but it feels like a place where you'd want to get that burger or have that cocktail.

00:16:56:19 - 00:16:58:14
Unknown
That's what we accomplish with our farm.

00:16:58:14 - 00:17:17:16
Unknown
We created outbound hotels because our guests want more. They want a place that feels like the place they want a burger that isn't just a burger. They want a cocktail or a craft beer that was brewed locally that was made by someone who cares. That's what Outbound Hotel is a place that cares.

00:17:17:16 - 00:17:39:18
Unknown
We created outbound hotels because our guests expect more. They want a burger made by someone who cares. They want to drink a beer that was made up the street. They want a musician that lives in the cabin on the other side of the mountain. That is the sense of place that draws in both the locals and the people who want that local experience.

00:17:39:18 - 00:18:01:22
Unknown
We created outbound hotels because our guests expect more. They want a cocktail that was made with some gin that was distilled up the street, or beer made by a craft brewer around the corner. They want a musician from the local town. Because we're creating a place that's appealing to the locals, and a place where people want to feel like a local

00:18:01:22 - 00:18:08:02
Unknown
we're creating a place that's appealing to the locals. And for those people who want to feel like a local.

00:18:08:02 - 00:18:33:18
Unknown
One of the things that makes outbound outbound is we have more than one kind of accommodations. My favorite accommodation is our lodges. We built these lodges because. Yes. Want a place that feels like home. A place that they can call their own. Maybe a place that they can stay with their families and have the rest of the family stay in the lodge next door.

00:18:33:20 - 00:18:42:01
Unknown
It creates a sense of place where perhaps they could have their own meal in their cabin, their own comfort, their own solace, their own solitude.

00:18:42:01 - 00:19:00:07
Unknown
One of the great things about our bond hotels are our lodges. We designed our lodges to be a comfortable little getaway. Your own home away from home. A place where you can have some privacy and seclusion, maybe have a meal together as a family and have the rest of the family stay in their own lodge, maybe next door.

00:19:00:07 - 00:19:22:08
Unknown
We have looked at hundreds of sites throughout. We have looked at hundreds of locations throughout the United States. And actually, beyond trying to find the perfect outbound locations. Because what makes outbound outbound is just enough character, just enough history, just enough unique spaces and places.

00:19:22:10 - 00:19:39:08
Unknown
Outdoor spaces where people can come together. Indoor spaces that feel comfortable, unique and full of character. And supported by some great food and beverage. Not too far away from town and not too far away from the slopes or the trails.

00:21:22:14 - 00:21:47:05
Unknown
Hey. Hello, I'm John Daly. My name is John Daly, and I'm an executive vice president with Waterton. It's an organization that is also part of the outbound organization. My responsibilities are the design and construction department and oversee, the progress that we're seeing out here and kind of get it started from conception through completion.

00:21:47:05 - 00:22:19:19
Unknown
Hi. My name is John Daly. I'm the executive vice president of design and construction. Waterton. Outbound. Our responsibilities begin at the start of, the acquisitions. We collaborate and coordinate with Mathieu on the, acquisitions team. Helped develop a Performa. That, in fact, makes sense. And pens and, our department begins the execution of the development and building process.

00:22:19:19 - 00:22:47:11
Unknown
Well, the must haves, is something that, Matthew marrying is, right on top of, To date, Matthew has found properties in Stowe, Vermont, Mammoth Lakes, California, Jackson Hole. And now currently this property here, which is, in Oakhurst, California, that's only 13 miles from this park. So the must haves are, fairly obvious.

00:22:47:11 - 00:22:52:07
Unknown
When I mentioned the locations that I just spoke about, it's about the outdoors. It's all about.

00:22:52:07 - 00:23:22:04
Unknown
The must haves are fairly obvious with with outbound properties in Stowe, Vermont. Mammoth lakes, California Jackson home. And currently now this property here, which is in Oakhurst, California, that is located 13 miles from the southern gate of the Yosemite National Park. So, as you can see, the locations that we're targeting, is there to celebrate the outdoors, which is a big part of the outbound theme.

00:23:22:06 - 00:23:32:14
Unknown
And, Matthew has done a great job to this point in locating those opportunities and being smart about where those opportunities lie.

00:23:32:14 - 00:24:03:20
Unknown
It's genuine location. It's it's location. And and and what the location and surrounding area offers in nature, if you will. It's conducive to biking and hiking, and all outdoor activities. That's primarily the driving point for the outbound brand, that we support and the property support. It's about being outside outbound. It's a lot about being inside. We're trying to, put together a property that is, a nice place for you to come and rest your head.

00:24:03:21 - 00:24:27:06
Unknown
It's clean, and, it allows you to get up and get out and enjoy what the the area has to offer. It's not about so much, the hotel room. Although we take pride in our hotel rooms, but it's more about the outside. As I said, we want to. You want a clean place to look to? To stay, feel secure, have amenities.

00:24:27:08 - 00:24:31:07
Unknown
But it's really your base camp for enjoying the surrounding areas.

00:24:31:07 - 00:24:35:10
Unknown
The construction process is a generic term. If you will.

00:24:35:10 - 00:24:40:07
Unknown
Our process begins, as I said earlier, with the the start of the acquisitions.

00:24:40:12 - 00:25:07:09
Unknown
We're assisting the acquisitions team in developing costs. At a high level, whatever they're looking at, be it an existing property or a new property, a ground up property like this one. And then as that proforma develops further and further, and if it pans out, that's the budget that we'll begin to utilize for development and from development and design and then into construction.

00:25:07:09 - 00:25:39:07
Unknown
So we are from cradle to grave, where at the inception, we manage the architecture, we manage the design, and we manage the construction process. And in doing so, we're able to keep, our high points. On point and allow the outbound, experience to develop and begin construction, see it through to the end, and turn it over to the operations team.

00:25:39:07 - 00:26:00:14
Unknown
So the construction process is, as an example here at the outbound Yosemite, we're now two and a half years into this from the day I first showed up with Matthew. And we've just broken ground about four months ago. And, if all goes well, we should be open, the summertime of 2025.

00:26:00:14 - 00:26:22:21
Unknown
Yeah. So the difference between outbound there's so many and our other sto, properties are other outbound number two. The difference between, outbound Yosemite and the other outbound properties. The major difference is that this is purely ground up. This was 17 raw acres was said before. It was 17 acres of opportunity.

00:26:22:23 - 00:26:46:11
Unknown
Blank canvas as opposed to the other three that we've done or existing properties. That we did do ground up on two of those other at the Stowe property and also at the Mammoth Lakes property. We also did some ground up stuff. We did 30 cabins in the Mammoth Lakes. We did an additional 13 cabins at the Stowe property, and we also converted a what would be a pole barn into 14 keys.

00:26:46:13 - 00:27:16:22
Unknown
We did an infill there. Here, we're literally starting from the ground up. We will be doing all the infrastructure. We're doing all the water lines, the sewage lines, the sewage treatment plant, water treatment as required, roadways, lighting, electric. We're bringing in all the utilities. So this is truly a a blank canvas. Probably in the end, truly in the true development, definition, if you will.

00:27:17:00 - 00:27:22:14
Unknown
So that's that's the major difference between outbound Yosemite and the other three at this moment.

00:27:22:14 - 00:27:45:14
Unknown
Countless people, countless people, countless departments. Can you restate it? Can you say. Sure. It takes countless people to bring this to life. Thank you. The amount of people and organization it takes to bring an album to fruition. It varies, of course, but there's an enormous amount of effort. And people and divisions and departments.

00:27:45:16 - 00:28:12:10
Unknown
Third parties, cities, city managers. It begins with, partnering with the local people, local towns, local authorities. We're here to be a good neighbor. We're we're, We're not the the dirty word developer that most people like to use. We truly want to gain, everyone's trust. And and we're sincere about being a good neighbor.

00:28:12:10 - 00:28:42:12
Unknown
Wherever we are. The amount of local employment that we we endeavor with, with all our outbound is the majority of the, the people are local that are building and supplying materials to the, to the outbound projects. So how many people say it takes a village? It's not, it's not any one individual. It's a conglomerate of so many different professionals, and people that, come to work every day.

00:28:42:12 - 00:28:48:00
Unknown
And so I couldn't give you that number, but it's, it's well over 100 on every project.

00:28:48:00 - 00:29:10:11
Unknown
For me personally, the magic begins the day it opens. We're we're not. That's the the celebratory time is that we've gotten the project completed across the finish line and handed over to operations so that it can become the outbound, property that we've all envisioned. But for me, it's the day it opens.

00:29:10:13 - 00:29:12:20

And not a moment before that.

like breaking ground is exciting. It's it's it's I guess for me at this point in my career, it's exciting to see other people get excited about this.

00:29:22:18 - 00:29:45:06

I've been doing this a long time and enjoy working with people who get excited about things like this. I'm not to be a Debbie Downer, but for me it's about trying to make the project happen and get it done on time and on budget. And that takes a lot of attention and, focus. So my focus is not on celebrating the magic.

00:29:45:06 - 00:29:49:20

It's about developing something that others can appreciate the magic once it's open.

The difference between the outbound brand and other hotels in the same market. Or, if you will, from a personal standpoint, I know that the outbound concept and practice is genuine. It's not. It's not about, of course you need marketing. You need to. You need, brand recognition and all those things. I think it may comes a little easier because, the outbound concept and the people behind outbound, our sincere about it, and it makes it a lot easier.

00:30:25:00 - 00:30:41:09

And I think it's a differentiator between us and others. And that's my opinion. I know how sincere the outbound theme and program is. So I would say that's that's for myself. That's what makes the the primary difference.

00:30:41:11 - 00:31:02:16

Right. It's, something that came to mind is like, Alvin has real soul. I feel like a lot of hotel chains. You can feel it's a great or lifeless. I think you're right. You want to say something? Maybe like that? Sure. For me, the difference is the outbound brand has genuine soul, if you will. It's. There isn't anything fake about it.

00:31:02:18 - 00:31:24:20

Of course, we have marketing and branding, all those things that obviously have to happen from a business level. But I think if you come and experience the outbound, brand and the outbound experience, it's genuine. You will clearly walk away knowing that it's, it's meant to, fill your soul, if you will. It's sincere.

the expertise that's brought to these projects in the upheld brand, if you will, is the combination of the professionals that are are within that organization. People like Matt, Mary, David Schwartz, who's Waterton CEO and Pete Milam, who is a co-founder of Waterton. You're since they have sincere professionals who've been doing this for a real long time.

00:31:53:06 - 00:32:21:16

I've been in the construction development world for over 40 years. So the team that we have and the people that we have behind us, we have an awful lot of industry experience and knowledge and, I think that's what really separates Waterton from many others. And we actually execute in-house as opposed to so many others through third party development, and just hire others to do it for them.

We're genuinely an active part of, as I said before, we're hiring the architect. We're managing the architect were hired, the engineer, we're managing the engineer, we're hiring the landscape architect, we're hiring the designer, and we're at every one of those milestones as we go through the process. And then we're managing, of course, the construction. So I think that formula, has an owner's eye on it all the time.

00:32:46:09 - 00:33:00:07
Unknown
And and not just the owner's eye, but the owner's representation at any given point in time, in my opinion, our experts. So I think that's one of the separating points of Waterton outbound from others.

Well, they up on Yosemite. Property will consist of 105 single cabins, a conference center that will have 14 hotel rooms above it, and, swimming pools for activity. There'll be a car park. The program is you will park your car in the parking lot and then utilize a golf cart or walk.

00:33:25:13 - 00:33:45:23
Unknown
But for your luggage and stuff, you'll check in at the conference center, and then you'll take your luggage to your cabin. So that's the overall, program is, again, about the outdoors. We don't want to have cars driving around the resort, if you will. So we want to again, bring you back to nature to feel like you're in nature.

00:33:46:00 - 00:33:54:04

So that's probably the biggest difference that we have here at Yosemite Outbound that we have, the other properties.
