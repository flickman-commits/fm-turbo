enjoying the entertainment.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We also have partnerships with certain individual players as well, so we can work with those to create content series that we push out mostly in the States, but obviously it does touch our other divisions as well.","startTime":"07:16","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When there's an interest in football, in particular the MLS series, we also work with Red Bull Media House, which gives us access and ability to advertise in their other events.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"Catherine

Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you guys.","startTime":"08:15","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it sounds like you're doing, you know, all this content stuff.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:18","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you guys think about it?","startTime":"08:18","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, why even do it?","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's the benefit in you guys with doing these partnerships and this content around it?","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And is there any other kind of, like, new avenues you're

Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:32","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So basically we.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The reason we chose Red Bull as our partnership is the approach that the athletes have to being the best is very similar to the approach that you need to have as a trader to be able to, you know, reach the levels of trading that you want to either make it your.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your main income or to certainly supplement your income, whether it's, you know, sending your kid to private school or paying into your pension that little bit more, whatever it may be, to reach those life goals that you personally have.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"09:02","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the relationship between how the athletes approach life and how traders need to approach life is quite aligned.","startTime":"09:02","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then from Red Bull side, it was really, for us, it was brand awareness.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:15","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we wanted to increase the brand awareness globally, and Red Bull was a good vehicle to particularly push it from the Oanda point of view.","startTime":"09:15","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We also have a brand ambassador, though, Robert Lewandowski.","startTime":"09:24","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't know if you follow a European football at all, like soccer.","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:31","endTime":"09:32","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Robert Lewandowski is a star striker in Barcelona.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So he's originally Polish and we have a huge Polish entity with lots like it's a big side of the business for us in Poland.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the relationship between Levandowski being Polish and working, you know, part of the Barcelona soccer team opens him up to the whole of Europe.","startTime":"09:46","endTime":"09:57","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then Singapore has a really big following of European football as well.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"10:03","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that kind of cross borders for us.","startTime":"10:03","endTime":"10:05","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So he's our global ambassador.","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we work with him to do and his team to do quite a lot of ads and campaigns that push our relationship with him because he again is increasing our brand.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:19","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I guess authenticity is probably the right word.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:22","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"10:23","endTime":"10:23","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:25","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"10:25","endTime":"10:25","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it sounds like there's a lot of alignment between athletes and traders and so these sort of partnerships make a lot of sense.","startTime":"10:25","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you looks like you guys take kind of more like long term positions, find people who like really resonate with you guys and then like build out almost content series or like repeated content with them.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then where are you guys pushing this content?","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how are people seeing it?","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:50","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Depends.","startTime":"10:50","endTime":"10:51","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have a fair few campaigns that are blasted on out of home spots and then you go right through the funnel.","startTime":"10:51","endTime":"10:58","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So awareness being majority out of home.","startTime":"10:58","endTime":"11:00","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we'd use certain awareness levels through, you know, banners, social, YouTube, things like that.","startTime":"11:00","endTime":"11:08","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then we also have consideration again predominantly pushing through banners, social, YouTube mainly 15s at that point and then conversion where you're just pushing people to those landing pages and trying to get them to finally sign the dotted line.","startTime":"11:08","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we use the full funnel to our full advantage.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:30","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And a lot of stuff is digital out of home and then like, you know, just standard social pushing and paid socials, youtubes.","startTime":"11:31","endTime":"11:40","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have a lot of integration with Trading View.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Trading View is.","startTime":"11:43","endTime":"11:45","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a platform that you can trade on and Oanda and Trading View in most of our entities are very well connected and we do quite a lot of advertising through TradingView as well.","startTime":"11:47","endTime":"11:56","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so just from my understanding, Trading View is it's a media company that talks about trading or it's its own platform.","startTime":"12:00","endTime":"12:09","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like they offer something different than you guys and so it makes sense for them to advertise you guys on their platform.","startTime":"12:09","endTime":"12:14","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So kind of how to explain it better?","startTime":"12:15","endTime":"12:18","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a little bit like how Photoshop would be to a designer.","startTime":"12:19","endTime":"12:22","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's the tool that you need to complete the task.","startTime":"12:22","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Trading View, we have our own Awanza trading app.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have TradingView and we have MetaTrader 5 and 4.","startTime":"12:29","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So these are all trading platforms that brokers can tap into.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Gotcha.","startTime":"12:42","endTime":"12:42","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so Trading View is owned by you guys?","startTime":"12:42","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, Trading View is owned by TradingView, Matter is owned by Meta and then we're owned by us and we connect our apps into them.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you're a trader with Oanda, you're able to connect your Oanda account to your TradingView account or your Meta5 account or 4 and trade simultaneously across platforms.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"13:05","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because the one thing we discovered was traders as creatures of habit, they do not like change.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:10","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So once that on that TradingView platform will say they're heavily rooted in it.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:15","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They've got all of that algorithm set up exactly as they want them.","startTime":"13:15","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to move from, you know, Trading View to Meta to Aanda to anybody else is really complicated and they will potentially lose out on opportunities by shifting around.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:30","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they like to be in the platform that they like to be in so they reconnected with them and it helps get a bigger share of the wallet.","startTime":"13:30","endTime":"13:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To be brutally honest with the majority of traders.","startTime":"13:41","endTime":"13:44","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Love it.","startTime":"13:45","endTime":"13:45","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That makes a lot of sense.","startTime":"13:45","endTime":"13:46","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, people don't like change.","startTime":"13:47","endTime":"13:48","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for you guys for 2025, from a marketing standpoint, what are the big goals?","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what is there trying to push into new markets, double down on certain things.","startTime":"13:54","endTime":"13:57","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just so I know kind of where your guys heads at.","startTime":"13:57","endTime":"13:59","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"14:00","endTime":"14:00","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're looking to generally increase awareness across the globe.","startTime":"14:00","endTime":"14:04","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We are pushing really hardly.","startTime":"14:04","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really hardly.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not a word.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:08","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really hard.","startTime":"14:08","endTime":"14:09","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Both the States and throughout Europe we've got other business lines that are based in Singapore and the emerging markets.","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:19","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're looking to grow those in general.","startTime":"14:19","endTime":"14:21","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're just looking to, you know, grow and keep a steady increase on the revenue that comes in.","startTime":"14:21","endTime":"14:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, love it.","startTime":"14:30","endTime":"14:31","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Amazing.","startTime":"14:31","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:33","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you know the company Huel?","startTime":"14:33","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, the protein drinks.","startTime":"14:35","endTime":"14:37","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was going to say they're UK based.","startTime":"14:38","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was wondering.","startTime":"14:41","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We just did a project with them end of last year because they obviously are massive in UK based company and they're pushing into the States and so we did some kind of like spokesman style advertising that was like their big issue was like all the content they created in the UK like felt very UK and like you know, from the actors to the talent to the jokes to the, just the language.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"15:07","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we kind of helped them translate a bit of like their value prop to a US audience and like tap into some of like the, you know, stuff that would feel relatable to the American version of like the.","startTime":"15:07","endTime":"15:21","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Their UK customer.","startTime":"15:21","endTime":"15:23","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's something that was kind of interesting.","startTime":"15:23","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm seeing a little bit of like, with you guys, same sort of deal.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's like you guys are a Canadian ish company, UK ish company.","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But there's all these, like, new markets that you're like, trying to tap into and grow into.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So potentially could be something to explore there, I think.","startTime":"15:36","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"From like, just from what I'm seeing, it sounds like you guys are doing a ton and you have a lot of growth goals.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:47","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you guys have, like, how do you execute on this stuff right now?","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"15:50","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm sure, like, you have to be.","startTime":"15:50","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sounds like creating content around the world.","startTime":"15:51","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or are you guys just creating like generic content and then just like using static kind of text and display stuff to kind of like alter it towards the markets you're looking to get in front of?","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"16:05","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"16:05","endTime":"16:05","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have basically the marketing department is split into channels.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you've got my team that are creative, we have another team which is PR and organic PR on organic social.","startTime":"16:11","endTime":"16:18","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we have a acquisition team.","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:21","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And basically the acquisition team have leads per division or per region per country.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:27","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they will work really closely with the regional business leads to find out, you know, what's doing really well, what needs to be pushed harder.","startTime":"16:28","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They'll then connect with, they'll write briefs and they'll push them into my team.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're producing campaigns that are localized, dependent on the country that they're going to.","startTime":"16:41","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The only time things are really crossed and shared is if the hero concept would be relevant to going from, you know, maybe the American to the Canadian are not too far disconnected.","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it generally we can share a concept and just tweak the offer, tweak the language.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:04","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, you know, the.","startTime":"17:04","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously the regulatory rationales are different.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very careful.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, we wouldn't very often, you know, recycle a concept from say, the UK to the States because the mindset's completely different.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:18","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It just doesn't really work.","startTime":"17:18","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, we have bespoke campaigns because we.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:24","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Part of our brand is about being customer focused or customer centric, but also about being localized, being feet on the ground.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:34","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We never want to be seen as a company that is just, you know, one foot in the bath and not bothering to customize said advertisements or product offering for the people of the country that you're going to.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:47","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"17:48","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one foot in the bath just means, like not fully in it.","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, yes, sorry, yeah, that's very English.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:54","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"17:56","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I like that.","startTime":"17:56","endTime":"17:56","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"See, that's a good example.","startTime":"17:56","endTime":"17:57","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, you know, you make an ad that says that and then the US people are like one foot in the bath.","startTime":"17:57","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, that one's pretty self explanatory.","startTime":"18:03","endTime":"18:04","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we can figure it out, but I've just never heard it before.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, that makes a lot of sense.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It sounds like you guys have like kind of the acquisition team and some of the other marketing departments are getting maybe like data on like, okay, what sort of stuff's working and then they're helping you guys, like the creative team to produce localized campaigns that are like bespoke to the kind of region that you're going to be using them in.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:28","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly that.","startTime":"18:28","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, cool.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:30","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think, I mean, based off all that, I think if there were a way for us to work together, it would probably be on the US Market as that's where we're based.","startTime":"18:30","endTime":"18:38","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's kind of like were saying, like the culture that we're tapped into would make a ton of sense for us to help.","startTime":"18:39","endTime":"18:46","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, from a strictly production standpoint, it was like, hey, we need someone to go to Singapore and help us, like just film for sure.","startTime":"18:46","endTime":"18:53","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if you're like, we need help on tapping into Singapore culture.","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"18:56","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's not us.","startTime":"18:56","endTime":"18:57","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"18:58","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But from a US standpoint, that is definitely something that we could be an asset to you guys on.","startTime":"18:58","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's like helping to either take concepts you guys already have based off data and flush them into like actual creative, which is sounds like kind of what your team is, is responsible for.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:14","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then also taking those creative concepts, campaigns, and then turning them to like finished assets.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:20","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does that kind of make sense?","startTime":"19:21","endTime":"19:22","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, for sure.","startTime":"19:22","endTime":"19:23","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:23","endTime":"19:23","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can be basically end to end.","startTime":"19:23","endTime":"19:25","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can conceptualize or take a concept and regionalize it as well as.","startTime":"19:25","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we give you a concept, you would blast it out into all the different shapes and sizes and media types.","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And do you guys.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:36","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Would you deal with like voiceovers and stuff?","startTime":"19:36","endTime":"19:37","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So would you be able to.","startTime":"19:37","endTime":"19:39","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, cool.","startTime":"19:39","endTime":"19:40","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like voice talent.","startTime":"19:40","endTime":"19:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"19:41","endTime":"19:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We do.","startTime":"19:41","endTime":"19:42","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we've done.","startTime":"19:42","endTime":"19:42","speaker_name":"Matt

cool.","startTime":"19:54","endTime":"19:55","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Honestly, the.","startTime":"19:55","endTime":"19:56","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The thing that takes more time is sifting through them all and like, people will do.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, people will do reads for you.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:02","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like they'll basically read the whole thing for You.","startTime":"20:02","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we just did a hotel project last week and we needed like a female voiceover.","startTime":"20:04","endTime":"20:07","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you can say like, you know, we want someone that's, you know, young, vibrant, and people will match it pretty well.","startTime":"20:08","endTime":"20:13","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think we got 150 applicants literally in an

off.","startTime":"20:19","endTime":"20:21","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was just like, this is too much.","startTime":"20:21","endTime":"20:22","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, at a certain point it's like, I mean, it's with like hiring, it's like you don't want 3,000 applicants, you want 20 good ones.","startTime":"20:22","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's how it works.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yes, we can do voiceovers, we can do editing, you know, the full kind of production.","startTime":"20:29","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"Matt

good.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:41","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's your cost structure?","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:43","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like how do you generally work?","startTime":"20:43","endTime":"20:44","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you do per project?","startTime":"20:44","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you do retainer?","startTime":"20:46","endTime":"20:47","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You like, how do you, are you hourly?","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:50","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, what's your setup for?","startTime":"20:50","endTime":"20:52","speaker_name":"Catherine Collingwood","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:53","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Two most common.","startTime":"20:53","endTime":"20:54","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"First most common project based.","startTime":"20:54","endTime":"20:56","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Typically, you know, you'd say, hey, we have this campaign, we need to make this happen.","startTime":"20:56","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it would include this.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Whether it's, you know, taking this concept and flushing out, so including some creative development in there, or it's like creative is already done.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:07","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We just need production that kind of like would be obviously a lower cost because we're not doing that.","startTime":"21:07","endTime":"21:12","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The creative development side.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we just give you like one fixed fee for that project for that campaign, which would include all, you know, our costs baked into that.","startTime":"21:13","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it would just be like one number for you guys to handle.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the second most common would be like that but as a retainer.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:27","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's.","startTime":"21:27","endTime":"21:28","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If there's.","startTime":"21:28","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I typically don't like to do that like right away just because, you know, nobody's worked with each other yet.","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"Matt Hickman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we probably shouldn't get
